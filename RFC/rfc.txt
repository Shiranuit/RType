RFC ????                    R-Type Protocol                November 2020

1. Introduction

    This document will describe how our protocol works for our R-Type.

    But first of all, what is an R-Type? R-Type is a game released the 
    first of July, 1987. Since then, many versions have come out,
    updating graphics, gameplay mechanics and more. Our R-Type is a
    1 to 4 player R-Type. Every player is considered a client, and each
    client communicates to a server that handles the game logic.

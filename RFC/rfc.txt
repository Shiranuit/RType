RFC 69420                   R-Type Protocol                November 2020

1. Introduction

    This document will describe how our protocol works for our R-Type.

    But first of all, what is an R-Type? R-Type is a game released the 
    first of July, 1987. Since then, many versions have come out,
    updating graphics, gameplay mechanics and more. Our R-Type is a
    1 to 4 player R-Type. Every player is considered a client, and each
    client communicates to a server that handles the game logic.

4. UDP Protocol

    All the comunication between the server and the clients once the 
    game has started are done via UDP Protocol.

    All the different packet type exchanged are separated in 9 classes
    that inherit the base packet class.

    4a. Position Packet

        The Position Packet is used to send the position of all entity
        to the clients.

        The packet written in the buffer looks like this:

            Double x;
            Double y;
            Unsigned int type;

        This corresponds to the position x, y and the type of entity for 
        the client to draw.

    4b. Move Packet 

        The Move Packet class is use by the clients to signal a player
        movement input.

        The packet written in the buffer looks like this:

            Int vx;
            Int vy;

        In which vx and vy is the vector that define the movement of
        the player of this client.

    4c. Player Instanciate Packet

        This packet is used to create each player entity in the ECS.

        For this this packet take an EntityId which permit to 
        differentiate all player from another.

    4d. Spawn Packet

        The Spawn Packet is used to spawn an entity (player, enemy ...)

        This packet is made using a Position packet, and create a 
        new entity of the type and the position of the Position Packet

    4e. Fire Packet

        The Fire packet signal the server if a player is holding the
        fire button from each clients.

        The packet written in the buffer looks like this:

            Bool holding;

        The boolean is true if the client is holding the fire button
        and false when not pressed.

    4f. Damage Packet

        This package is sent whenever damage is dealt to an entity
        having health point.

        The packet written in the buffer looks like this:

            Int damage;
            Int hp;
            Int MaxHp;

        Damage corresponds to the damage taken, hp to the remaining
        health point and MaxHp to the maximum health point of the
        entity given.

    4g. Death Packet

        This packet is used to destroy the entity who have run out
        of health point.

        For this this packet take an EntityId which permit to 
        differentiate all entity who can be destroyed.

    4h. Ping Packet

        The Ping Packet is used by the server to ping the clients
        every 0.1 seconds to make sure the information of all
        the client are up to date.
